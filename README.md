## Introduction
njuG (name might be changed) is a website built with Django 1.8. It aims to build social connections among LGBT groups in Nanjing University (may support other Chinese universities in the future).

## How to use
In order to ensure that our users are from universities, you should use an email address whose domain contains "edu" to sign up, e.g. "mike@nju.edu.cn".
