## Introduction
njuG is a simple social website built especially for LGBT students in universities located in the city of Nanjing, China. The current people in China are becoming much more friendly to homosexuality. However, due to the deep-rooted traditional culture, many of the homosexual people, especially the youth, who are well-educated, still find it very difficult to make their friends and families understand and accept their sexual orientation. 

I created this website with the hope of boosting the communication among gay students in universities, and pushing forward the public attention on this community. I wish my homosexual alumnus at Nanjing University will enjoy this website.
